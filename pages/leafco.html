	<p>With a 10 week deadline, our team wanted to create a fun, exciting and replayable game. Our plan was to let the players’ competitive nature shape the simple task of raking leaves into all things fun: rake dexterity, lawn control, and sabotage.</p>
	<p>Inspired by the mundane chore of raking, Leaf Co. is a fast and engaging experience where the leaf-raker with the most leaves on his tarp at day’s end wins the homeowners business, and more importantly their heart.</p>
	<p>My role was visual design and gameplay development, and I worked on the UI 3d models and visual style of the game. We were able to complete the game on time by creating a simple gameplay mechanic coupled with a low-poly art style.</p>
