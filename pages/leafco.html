	<p>With a 10 week deadline, our team wanted to create a fun, exciting, and replayable game. Our concept was to let the player’s competitive nature shape a simple task into an addicting game featuring tactical rake maneuvers, territorial squabbles, and sabotage.</p>
	<p>Inspired by the mundane chore of leaf raking, Leaf Co. is a fast and engaging experience where the leaf-raker with the most leaves on his tarp at day’s end wins the homeowner’s business and, more importantly, his heart.</p>
	<p>I worked on the 3D modeling and visual aesthetics of the game as well as contributing to gameplay development. We finished within our short timeframe by coupling a simple raking mechanic with a low-poly art style. The intentionally slow leaf-pulling action added to the game’s competitive tension as players had to decide between raking their own leaves and stealing from their opponent. Leaf Co. was received positively overall when we presented it at the 2014 RPI Game Fest.</p>
