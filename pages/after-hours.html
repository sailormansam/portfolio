	<p>Making it a habit to create every day allows me to constantly improve as a creator. I practice bringing new ideas to life through drawing and coding, learning new techniques and developing myself along the way. Using these skills, I want to create websites where people have friendly interactions and delight in their experience.</p>

	<h2 class="title" ng-style="{ 'color': p.project.color }">365 Days of Drawing</h2>
	<p>Inspired by the sense of space and emotion portrayed in concept art, I wanted to learn to paint my own. I set up an Instagram account and posted every day for one year to share my progress with others. I met many friendly and talented people along the way who helped to keep me motivated and on the right track.</p>
	
	<h2 class="title" ng-style="{ 'color': p.project.color }">Coding Everyday</h2>
	<p>After I began to see progress with drawing, I added coding to my everyday schedule. I wanted a place to experiment with and create all of the ideas floating around in my head. Since the inception, I've created a small game with level editor, a website to hold some comics that I never wrote, and my current portfolio site. I learned a lot about Phaser, Gulp, Angular, and setting up my own site with DeployBot and NGINX.</p>

	<h2 class="title" ng-style="{ 'color': p.project.color }">Moving Forward</h2>
	<p>At first doing both coding and drawing every day wasn’t bad, but as days went by the quality of one or both began to suffer. Even though I was learning and progressing my focus began to meander, and I felt I wasn’t learning as much as I could. I’ve since revised my schedule to only work on either one or the other in a single day in order to stay focused. I still do something to improve myself every day with the goal of developing as an artist, designer, and developer.</p>
