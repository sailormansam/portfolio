	<p>Our imaginative team set out to create an engaging, story driven 2D game with Spectrum. Overwhelmed with the nostalgia of our neighborhood games as children, we were inspired to capture the limitless, playful imagination of youth. Spectrum takes players back to their own childhoods as they play as Grey, the young character, who uses his imagination to change the environment, solve problems, and complete levels.</p>

	<p>I was the engine developer creating all of the internals and rules for interactions. I created a workflow inside Flash so our artist could design levels applying art to parallax layers and using collision volumes for camera control. Since the engine worked with bitmap collisions, there was also a collision layer that could be customized visually, allowing complex landscape. Projectile collisions were included as well, along with in-game asset and item swapping.</p>
