	<p>The Wallace Center at RIT provides students, faculty and staff with a multitude of resources. This site contains a collection of stories about students who have used these resources creatively and gone on to achieve great successes. Just prior to my graduation, I laid the groundwork for this project at RIT Production Services. I created a homepage template that would later be populated with additional stories and pages. I implemented CSS animations and transitions to give the site responsive and delightful interactions.</p>
